// Setup
const width = 1000;

const svg = d3.select("#map")


/*
D3's methods support chaining, which means you can link several together in a row
to accomplish what you're trying to do. The next step your script should tack an
`svg` element to the `div` you have selected in your `svg` variable.

Chain D3's `append()` method to the end of the `select()` one, and pass it the
argument `"svg"`.
