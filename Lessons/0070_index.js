// Setup


/*
As noted in the first lesson, D3 is designed to work with common web standards,
such as HTML, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). This project will use D3
to draw a map with SVG, which you'll add to your page with this script.

SVG elements have `height` and `width` attributes, so the browser knows the size
and how to display them.

Using the `const` keyword, declare a `width` variable and set it to `1000`, and
declare a `height` variable and set it to `700`.
