/*
As you saw previously with the `svg` element, when D3 adds elements to the DOM,
you can target them with CSS rules just like any other element on the page.

Some styles will dynamically change depending on how the user interacts with the
map - those rules will stay in the script. One style that will remain static on
our map is the color of the outline around each country. (You could declare this
rule in the script, it depends on how you want to organize your code.)

For a `path` element, you change this with the `stroke` property.

Add a CSS rule that targets all elements with the class `countries`, and give
them a `stroke` color of white (`#fff`).
